## 👋 Contributions

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a Pull Request. You can also simply [open an issue](https://github.com/RomanFama592/tic-tac-toe-world/issues).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use [`conventional commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and ensure that the code passes the linter test, pull requests are not accepted without this last point.

Keep in mind that every change to the website would require updating the version in the `package.json`.

### versioning of the page

- `format of verisoned`
  - `MAYOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`

### most relevant types of changes that affect versioning
- `minor-feat`: Only used for making minor changes to existing things. update a `PATCH` version.
- `fix`: Used when fixing a bug. update a `PATCH` version.
- `feat`: Used when adding substantial content anywhere on the page. update a `MINOR` version.

- The `MAJOR` version is only incremented when the `MINOR` version reaches 100 or there is a deep and general change across the entire page. This would only be handled by me, the repository owner.

1. Fork the project.

2. Clone your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/@your_username/tic-tac-toe-world
```

3. Create your Feature Branch.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
```

4. Push to the Branch.

```bash
git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
```

5. Open a Pull Request to branch `master`.

> [!WARNING]
> Respect the code styles: try to keep your pull requests as clean as possible, avoiding unnecessary changes like swapping a " for a ' and similar minor adjustments. If you wish to modify the styles, please do so in a separate pull request, and it will be evaluated accordingly.

### 🙏 Thank you very much to these individuals who contributed to this project.
